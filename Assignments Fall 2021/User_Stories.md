User Stories:

1.) As a researcher, I want to collect data from both the Motion Control and the External Motion Control (EMC) server so that I can see all data in real time in the same place.

2.) As a researcher, I want to select run setup options for running the EMC server so I can run a test with the correct setup parameters.

3.) As a researcher, I want to be able to start and stop Motion Control using a button, so I can control a test from the same software that I collect data from.
