#Abstract

Naval Medical Research Unit â€“ Dayton frequently runs flight simulations and collects data using a motion system and external motion control server to send commands and receive data. The purpose of the server is to allow the researcher to control the motion system from the control room. However, the current method of interacting with the server using remote shell SSH is not cohesive and inconvenient for the researcher. The EMC-GUI client provides a user interface that sends commands to and receives data from the server, allowing researchers to easily connect to the server.
