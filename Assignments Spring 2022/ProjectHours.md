# Project Hours

Since this was an individual project, the hours listed below make up the entirety of work done. This includes class assignments, coding and testing for both semesters. The majority of time was spent on coding and debugging. There were several challenges during development that added significantly to time spent on the project. The biggest issues were modifying the server code to properly listen for messages from the client and sending the data in a way that each software could read the data. This was an issue since the softwares were built on two different UDP frameworks. The goal over the course of the project was to consistently work on it for a few hours every day of the week. This was mostly successful, except for a few point where other assignments were due.
