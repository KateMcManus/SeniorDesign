# Abstract

Researchers at NAMRU-Dayton rely on an External Motion Control server to communicate with their flight simulator for research. The current method of interaction with the server is inconvenient. The purpose of the EMCGUI is to provide a client application with a convenient UI which can communicate directly with the server.
